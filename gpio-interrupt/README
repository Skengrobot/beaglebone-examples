This is an example of a rising edge interrupt on a implemented in user space
on a BeagleBone. The poll() function runs in a separate thread so you can
do whatever you want in main. I hope it's useful.

I used this to measure the speed of a car, so the function calculates a speed,
but you can use this structure for whatever you like.

The source can be cross-compiled with the included Makefile usign the Angstrom
toolchain or built directly on the Beaglebone.

A this is largely based on the code found here: https://developer.ridgerun.com/wiki/index.php/How_to_use_GPIO_signals
but I hope that I've added some useful comments.
