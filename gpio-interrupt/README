This is an example of a risin edge interrupt on a implemented in user space
on a BeagleBone. The poll() function runs in a separate thread so you can
do whatever you want in main. I hope it's useful.

The source can be cross-compiled with the included Makefile usign the Angstrom
toolchain or built directly on the Beaglebone.
